# Powerlevel10k Configuration README

This README provides an overview of my Powerlevel10k zsh prompt configuration, which was generated using the Powerlevel10k configuration wizard on 2024-03-12 at 18:15 MDT. This configuration is based on the `p10k-classic.zsh` style with a set of customized options to fit your terminal look and functionality.

## Git Status Color Configuration

The Powerlevel10k theme allows for detailed customization of the Git prompt, enabling users to get a quick understanding of their repository status directly from the prompt. Here's a breakdown of the colors you've configured for various Git statuses:

- **Clean Status**: The Git repository is in a clean state, indicating no changes or pending commits. This is typically represented with a green color, symbolizing that all changes are committed and there are no pending files to add or commit. I changed the color to DeepSkyBlue1 (39).

- **Untracked Files**: Files that are not tracked by Git are marked with a specific color, often red or yellow, to grab your attention. This indicates that there are files in the directory that aren't being tracked by Git. I changed the color to LightSkyBlue3 (109).

- **Modified Files**: When files have been modified but not staged for commit, they are highlighted. A common color choice is orange or yellow, signaling that there are changes that need to be staged. I changed the color to LightSalmon3 (173).

- **Staged Files**: Files that are staged and ready to be committed may be indicated with a brighter shade, such as a bold green, signifying that the files are ready to be committed.

- **Conflicts**: Merge conflicts are typically represented with a red color, clearly indicating immediate attention is required to resolve the conflicts before proceeding with other Git operations.

- **Behind/Ahead of Remote**: When your branch is ahead or behind the remote branch, it's often represented with blue or purple. This color coding provides a quick view of whether you need to push your commits or pull changes from the remote repository.

## Customization

You can tweak these colors and the Git status prompt settings by editing the `~/.p10k.zsh` file. The configuration allows for adjustments using `p10k configure`, enabling you to regenerate or tweak your prompt settings as per your evolving preferences or requirements.

## Tips

- **Color Customization**: Explore the one-liner provided in the configuration to print a colormap, assisting you in customizing your prompt colors.
- **Instant Prompt**: Optimized for quick shell startup, with the option to toggle the feature as needed.
- **Transient Prompt**: Reduces clutter by simplifying the prompt after commands are executed, keeping your terminal history clean and focused.

## Usage

To apply the configuration, source the generated script in your `.zshrc`:

```zsh
source ~/.p10k.zsh
```

You can edit the `~/.p10k.zsh` file to customize your prompt manually. For a more guided customization, run `p10k configure` in your terminal.
